At PrivacyCloud, we're looking for a software engineer with solid experience building enterprise-level web applications to join our product team in Gij√≥n (Asturias).

# What's PrivacyCloud?

PrivacyCloud is an early-stage startup based in Asturias and Madrid seriously disrupting the current ad-tech ecosystem by providing a set of tools focused on customer centricity and privacy-by-design.

## How do we build software?

- We are **strong believers of Agile practices**. We use GitLab extensively to document new features, host our codebase and perform continuous integration, deployment and delivery (on every single project). Feature branches do not last more than a couple of days. Period.
- We use a Kanban board to track progress and set priorities. No deadlines nor estimates. Once we agree on a feature, we take as much time as required to provide **high quality deliverables**.
- We are a **TypeScript** shop.
- We have a **solid testing culture** and we don't consider something to be completed if it doesn't have a good suite of integration and unit tests. You may even drive your development by using tests! ;D
- We help each other with **code reviews** (via pull/merge requests).
- Do you want to know more? take a look at our [public knowledge base in Notion](https://www.notion.so/privacycloud/PrivacyCloud-da4cabeab1a2474c8cfae98c0fe2094e).
